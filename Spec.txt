For this part of the assignment you will be using the same house
dataset as used for the data preparation part of the coursework.
You can use either the original data or a cleaned up version of
the data from the first part.

You are asked to build four machine learning prediction models
for predicting the mean house price from the other features
provided in the dataset.

As it is fairly easy to use the toolkit to generate multiple machine
learning models the marking here will be based on how you compare
the different approaches and how you try to improve your results.
You should produce metrics for your different approaches and use
those to say which is the best approach providing tables / graphs / figures
to show your results. You should demonstrate that you have tried to improve
the results of your models by trying different hyper-parameters and/or
manipulations for that type of ML model. It is expected that there will be
a short (no more than 300 words) report within your submission to explain
your results and what you have done.

Some hints:

Here is a notebook which might be a good starting point:
MachineLearningStart.ipynb Download MachineLearningStart.ipynb

Make sure that you separate testing data from training data to
ensure that you are testing your models on unseen data and not on
the same data that you learnt on.

A number of the features are such things as 'total_rooms' and 'total_bedrooms'.
This is for all houses in the area. As the size of the areas may be different it
is worth normalising these based on the number of properties in the area.

This is not a competition. The marks are based on how well you compare and contrast
the different models that you build rather than how you compare to others in the class.
